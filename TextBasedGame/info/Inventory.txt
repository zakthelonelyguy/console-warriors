The inventory has 5 spaces. This number cannot increase nor decrease.

It is advised that 3 spaces are reserved for weapons or abilites as more options in battles helps.
More attacks to choose from in battles will give you the upper hand.

The fourth and fifth are advised to be used for potions or any misc thing that might be added.
It is advised that potions are only to be used when needed.
Good potions are rare so don't use them often.

The reason the fourth and fifth are allocated is because useful potions are rarer than good abilites.
